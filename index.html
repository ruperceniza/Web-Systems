                <p>Hey! I'm Ruper. Welcome to a snippet of my life journey. This movie mirrors the romance and adventures I experienced during high school. A little background: I was born on July 25, 2003. I went to live in a small city named Panabo City. After, we moved back to Davao to have a school for college. My hobbies are playing video games and going on a long ride every now and then. What I am emphasizing about the movie is the romance I had during high school. Now, I embark on the final hurdle: college.
